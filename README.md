**USAGE OF DISCORD AND DISCORD BOT**

Discord is a voice, video, and text chat app that's used by tens of millions of people ages 13+ to talk and hang out with their communities and friends.

It's much easier to set up a Discord server and share the link with other users. The main goal here is to bring people together

Before creating your server, you have to get a Discord account set up. 

* Install the Discord app, then open it to continue the setup process.
* Press the Register button and enter your phone number or email address.
* Hit Next. Then you can input a Discord username and password you want to use for your account.
* Enter your date of birth, and then press the Create an account button to finish up here.
* From the main Discord app screen, tap the + button in the upper left corner.
* You use the Create My Own option to start an entirely new server or use any of the templates as needed.
* Decide if your Discord server is for a public community or you and your friends.


<h1> DISCORD BOT</h1>

Discord bots are AI-driven tools that can help you automate tasks on your Discord server. They make it a lot easier to build a community that is truly engaged and can be used to moderate your server, welcome new members, or even ban people who are creating a bad environment for everyone else.
<h3>Creating meet schedular bot</h3>

First of all we are creating a discord bot account
* Log in to the [Discord website](https://discord.com/).  
* Navigate to the [application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
* Click on the “New Application” button and give the application a name and click “Create”.
* Create a Bot User by navigating to the “Bot” tab and click “Add Bot”, click “Yes, do it!” to continue.
* Copy the token using the “Copy” button(Token is essentially your bot’s password, you should never share this with someone else.).


### Programming Bot
* Create a new repository in github
* Clone the repository using Git.

```
git clone https://github.com/lekshmi-02/Mia.git
```



```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akkupy/Homelab/main/scripts/install_portainer.sh | bash
```

### Login to Portainer.

Goto raspberry_ip:9000 and then login.
